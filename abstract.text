additional specifications

    Data Collection: Collect data on TikTok users, including their activity on the platform, their interests, and their mining preferences. This data could be collected using web scraping techniques or by using TikTok's API.

    Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the DAN model. This might involve cleaning the data, removing irrelevant information, and converting the data into a format that can be used by the model.

    DAN Model Training: Train the DAN model on the preprocessed data. The model should learn to predict the mining preferences of TikTok users based on their activity on the platform.

    Mining Group Formation: Once the DAN model is trained, use it to connect users with similar mining preferences to form peer-to-peer mining groups. Users with similar preferences should be grouped together, and they could then collaborate to mine Bitcoin together.

    Block Generation: Generate blocks of Bitcoin using a mining cycle of 23,000,000 DAN. The first block should contain 1,000,000 Bitcoin, and subsequent blocks should decrease in value by 50% and follow the Fibonacci sequence.

    Block Verification: Verify each block of Bitcoin using a consensus algorithm to ensure that it meets the network's requirements.

    Mining Rewards: Distribute mining rewards to the members of each mining group based on their contributions to the mining process.

    Testing and Refinement: Test the algorithm and refine it based on the results. This might involve adjusting the algorithm parameters or collecting more data to improve its accuracy.
