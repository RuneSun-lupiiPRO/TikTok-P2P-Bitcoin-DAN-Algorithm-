TikTok P2P Bitcoin DAN Algorithm

This is the first beta block of the TikTok P2P Bitcoin DAN algorithm. It is designed to mine Bitcoin using a peer-to-peer network and the DAN prediction model.
Implementations

This algorithm has been implemented in three programming languages: C, Python, and Java. Each implementation can be found in its respective directory in this repository:
    Directory:
    c-implementation/: Contains the C source code for the algorithm and instructions for compiling and running it.
    python-implementation/: Contains the Python source code for the algorithm and instructions for running it.
    java-implementation/: Contains the Java source code for the algorithm and instructions for compiling and running it.
    README.md: A README file that provides an overview of the algorithm, instructions for running the implementations, and some expectations for users who may not be familiar with the topics.
    
Expectations

This algorithm is intended for advanced users who are familiar with Bitcoin mining, peer-to-peer networking, and the DAN prediction model. Users should have a basic understanding of programming and be comfortable working with the programming languages used in the implementations.

If you are new to any of these topics, we recommend doing some research and familiarizing yourself with them before attempting to use this algorithm.
